# InfoSec Lab Writeups

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I showcase my journey through various information security labs, focusing on both offensive and defensive security practices. This repository contains CTF writeups, LAB reports, and notes that document my learning experiences as I move forward in the world of cybersecurity.

## üöÄ About This Repository

This repository includes:

- **Writeups**: Detailed explanations of lab challenges and solutions.
- **Reports**: Summaries of findings from different security assessments.
- **Learning Notes**: Personal reflections, key takeaways and so on.

I aim to improve my skills in information security and share my knowledge with others in the community. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

## üõ† Technologies Used

In my exploration of information security, I leverage a variety of tools and platforms for both offensive and defensive practices:

### Offensive Security Tools
- **Penetration Testing Tools**: Techniques used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
  - [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - A powerful Linux distribution tailored for penetration testing.
  - [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) - A penetration testing framework that helps find and exploit vulnerabilities.
  - [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) - A platform for web application security testing.
  - [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) - An open-source web application security scanner.
  - [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) - A widely used vulnerability assessment tool.
  - [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/) - An open-source vulnerability scanning tool.

### Defensive Security Tools
- **Security Monitoring and Incident Response**: Strategies for detecting and responding to security incidents.
  - [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) - An open-source network intrusion detection system.
  - [Suricata](https://suricata-ids.org/) - A high-performance network IDS, IPS, and network security monitoring engine.
  - [Security Onion](https://securityonion.net/) - A Linux distribution for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management.
  - [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/) - A tool used to identify and classify malware samples.


### Third-Party Lab Environments
- **Hands-On Learning Platforms**:
  - [Hack The Box (HTB)](https://www.hackthebox.com/) - A platform to practice penetration testing with various challenges and labs.
  - [TryHackMe (THM)](https://tryhackme.com/) - An interactive platform for learning cybersecurity through real-world scenarios.
  - [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) - A collection of vulnerable applications to practice penetration testing.

### Additional Resources
- **Documentation and Learning**:
  - [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) - A nonprofit foundation focused on improving software security.
  - [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) - A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
  - [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) - A framework to help organizations manage cybersecurity risk.
  - [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) - A community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types.
  - [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) - A list of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.
  - [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/) - Offers a variety of cybersecurity training and certification programs.

- **Vulnerability Databases**:
  - [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) - A comprehensive repository of vulnerability management data.
  - [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/) - A community-driven database of exploits and vulnerabilities.

These are just the tools I remember, and there are many more tools, resources, and websites that I will add whenever I recall them to commit here. Your understanding is appreciated!

These resources are invaluable for understanding vulnerabilities, threats, and best practices in information security. They support my continuous learning and provide insights into the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

These tools and platforms play a crucial role in my learning process, helping me to develop a well-rounded skill set in both offensive and defensive security practices.
